    In order to support legacy drivers without having to make the manager code

    actions needed in this wrapper:

    Method removed from new driver - remove the call-through method from this
                                     class, since the manager will no longer be
                                     calling it.
    Method signature (or meaning) changed - wrap the old method in a new
                                            signature here, and munge the input
                                            and output parameters accordingly.
    New method added to new driver - add a method to implement the new
                                     functionality here if possible. If that is

                                     functionality with legacy drivers.

    This wrapper contains the following support for newer manager code:

    - The current manager code expects domains to be represented as projects
      acting as domains, something that may not be possible in a legacy driver.
      Hence the wrapper will map any calls for projects acting as a domain back
      onto the driver domain methods. The caveat for this, is that this assumes
      that there can not be a clash between a project_id and a domain_id, in
      which case it may not be able to locate the correct entry.
