upgrade:
    - The legacy v2 API code was deprecated since Liberty release. The legacy
      v2 API code was removed in Newton release. We suggest that user should
      move to v2.1 API which compatible v2 API with more restrict input
      validation and microversions support. If user is still looking for v2
      compatible API before switch to v2.1 API, user can use v2.1 API code as
      v2 API compatible mode. That compatible mode is closer to v2 API
      behaviour which is v2 API compatible without restrict input validation
      and microversions support.
